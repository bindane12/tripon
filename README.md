# Hotel Loyalty Platform on Solana

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that implements a hotel loyalty points system on the Solana blockchain. It consists of an Anchor-based on-chain program and a Next.js web frontend.

Users can mint a "membership" token for a hotel, which then accumulates loyalty points over time for a real world asset value. These points can then be redeemed.

## Features

-   **Hotel Registration**: Hotel owners can register their hotel on the platform.
-   **Membership Minting**: Users can connect their Solana wallet and mint a membership token for a registered hotel for a small fee (0.01 SOL).
-   **Points Accumulation**: Loyalty points are automatically calculated and can be updated based on the duration the membership is held.
-   **Tiered Membership**: A tiered membership system (Basic, Silver, Gold, Platinum) that offers different benefits based on accumulated points.
-   **Points Redemption**: Users can redeem their accumulated points.
-   **User Dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard to view available hotels, manage memberships, and interact with the points system.

## Security and Logic Improvements

The smart contract has been updated with several security and logic improvements to ensure its robustness and reliability:

-   **Signer Authorization**: All privileged instructions now include proper signer authorization checks to ensure that only authorized accounts can perform sensitive actions.
-   **PDA Validation**: Program Derived Address (PDA) accounts are now correctly derived and validated to prevent account substitution attacks.
-   **Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow Protection**: All arithmetic operations now use checked arithmetic to prevent overflow and underflow errors.
-   **Timestamp and Redemption Validation**: The points calculation and redemption logic now includes validation checks to prevent logical flaws, such as negative timestamps or zero-value redemptions.

## Tiered Membership System

The platform now includes a tiered membership system to reward loyal users with additional benefits. The tiers are as follows:

-   **Basic**: 0-999 points (1x points multiplier)
-   **Silver**: 1,000-4,999 points (1.2x points multiplier)
-   **Gold**: 5,000-9,999 points (1.5x points multiplier)
-   **Platinum**: 15,000+ points (2x points multiplier)

Users are automatically upgraded to the next tier as they accumulate points.

## Listing Your Property on TripOn

If you are a hotel or property owner, you can apply to have your property listed on TripOn. The process is as follows:

1.  **Submit an Application:** Reach out to the TripOn team to start the application process. You will need to provide details about your property.
2.  **Verification:** The TripOn team will review your application and verify your property.
3.  **Onboarding:** Once verified, you will be onboarded onto the platform, and your property will be listed.

Please contact us at apply@tripon.example.com to start the process.

## Tech Stack

-   **Blockchain**: Solana
-   **Smart Contracts**: Anchor Framework (Rust)
-   **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Solana Web3**: `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/wallet-adapter` for wallet connection, and `@coral-xyz/anchor` for client-side program interaction.

## What's Next?

Our vision for TripOn extends far beyond a simple loyalty platform. We aim to build a comprehensive, decentralized ecosystem for the hotel industry. Here’s a glimpse of what we wo on deployment next : 

### 1. Room Ownership via NFTs

-   **Concept**: Imagine owning a piece of a hotel room and earning a share of its revenue. We are developing a feature that will allow users to buy, sell, and trade fractional ownership of hotel rooms as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain.
-   **How It Works**: Each NFT will represent a percentage of ownership in a specific room. As a shareholder, you will be entitled to a proportionate share of the income generated by that room. This model opens up new investment opportunities and allows anyone to become a stakeholder in the hospitality industry.

### 2. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

-   **Concept**: We believe in empowering our community. To that end, we are establishing a DAO that will give shareholders a direct voice in the platform’s governance and the management of listed properties.
-   **How It Works**: As a shareholder (i.e., an owner of a room NFT), you will have the right to vote on critical decisions, such as:
    -   **Property Management**: Changes in operational strategies or partnerships.
    -   **Platform Development**: Prioritizing new features and upgrades.
    -   **Treasury Management**: Allocating community funds for marketing, development, or other initiatives.

### 3. Enhanced Auditing and Transparency

-   **Concept**: To build trust and ensure the long-term success of the ecosystem, we are developing a robust, decentralized auditing system. This will provide an additional layer of security and transparency, protecting users from potential scams or mismanagement by partners.
-   **How It Works**: We plan to partner with reputable, third-party auditing firms to conduct regular, independent reviews of our partners' operations and financial statements. The results of these audits will be made publicly available on the blockchain, giving all stakeholders a clear and unbiased view of the health of their investments.

## How It Works

The application is split into two main parts: the on-chain program and the frontend client.

### On-Chain Program (Anchor)

The Anchor program, located in the `anchor/` directory, defines the core business logic and state management on the Solana blockchain.

#### Accounts

-   **`Config`**: A singleton account that stores the public key of the program admin.
-   **`Hotel`**: A Program Derived Address (PDA) account that stores information about a single hotel, including its name, owner, verification status, and the total supply of membership tokens.
-   **`Membership`**: A PDA account unique to a user and a hotel. It stores the user's points balance, when they joined, their current tier, and other relevant data for calculating points.

#### Instructions

-   `initialize_config()`: Initializes the program's configuration, setting the caller as the admin. This should only be called once.
-   `initialize_hotel(name)`: Creates a new `Hotel` account with the `verified` status set to `false`. Can only be called by a hotel owner.
-   `verify_hotel()`: Sets a hotel's `verified` status to `true`. Can only be called by the program admin.
-   `mint_membership_token()`: Creates a new `Membership` account for the calling user, linking them to a specific hotel. This costs 0.01 SOL, which is transferred to the hotel owner.
-   `calculate_and_update_points()`: Calculates points earned based on the time elapsed since the last update and adds them to the user's `Membership` account. It also updates the user's tier based on their new points balance.
-   `redeem_points(amount)`: Subtracts a specified number of points from a user's `Membership` account.

#### Admin Role and Hotel Verification

The contract now includes a simple admin role. The admin is responsible for verifying hotels before they can be used by users.


The workflow is as follows:
1.  The program authority calls `initialize_config()` once to become the admin.
2.  A hotel owner calls `initialize_hotel()` to register their hotel. The hotel is created in an unverified state.
3.  The admin calls `verify_hotel()` to approve the hotel, setting its `verified` flag to `true`.
4.  Once a hotel is verified, users can mint membership tokens for it.

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend, located in the `web/` directory, provides a user interface to interact with the on-chain program.

#### Key Pages & Components

-   **`/` (Home)**: The landing page that shows the user's wallet connection status.
-   **`/register-hotel`**: A form for hotel owners to register their hotel by calling the `initialize_hotel` instruction.
-   **`/dashboard`**: The main user dashboard.
    -   **Available Hotels**: Fetches and displays all `Hotel` accounts from the blockchain. Users can click a button here to mint a membership token.
    -   **My Memberships**: Fetches and displays all `Membership` accounts owned by the connected user. It shows their points balance, tier, and progress toward the next tier, and provides buttons to refresh or redeem points.
-   **`components/WalletContextProvider.tsx`**: Wraps the application to provide wallet connection logic from `@solana/wallet-adapter`.
-   **`components/Navbar.tsx`**: The main navigation bar with links to all pages and a wallet connection button.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   Yarn package manager
-   Rust
-   Solana CLI: [Installation Guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
-   Anchor CLI: [Installation Guide](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd TRIP.on
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Anchor program:**
    ```bash
    cd ../anchor
    anchor build
    ```

---

## Testing the Program

To run the test suite on the Anchor program:

1.  Navigate to the `anchor` directory.
2.  Run the `anchor test` command. This will build the program, deploy it to a local test validator, and run the tests defined in `tests/hotel-loyalty.ts`.

```bash
cd anchor
anchor test
```

---

## Deployment

A helper script is provided to streamline deployment to Solana's devnet.

### Airdrop SOL

Before deploying or testing on devnet, you'll need devnet SOL. Use the `airdrop-sol.sh` script:

```bash
./scripts/airdrop-sol.sh <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

### Deploy to Devnet

The `deploy-devnet.sh` script will build the program, deploy it, and copy the resulting IDL to the frontend for you.

```bash
./scripts/deploy-devnet.sh
```

The script will output the new Program ID. Make sure to update this ID in `anchor/src/lib.rs` and `web/idl/anchor.json` if it has changed.
